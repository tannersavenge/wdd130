        <blockquote>
            <!-- Quote 1 -->
            <p>"When we are racked or harrowed up or tormented by guilt or burdened with grief, He can heal us. While we do not fully understand how the Atonement of Christ was made, we can experience the peace of God which passeth all understanding." Boyd K. Packer</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <!-- Quote 2 -->
            <p>"Having 'descended below all things,' He comprehends, perfectly and personally, the full range of human suffering! A spiritual sung in yesteryear has an especially moving and insightful line: 'Nobody knows the troubles I’ve seen, nobody knows but Jesus.' Truly, Jesus was exquisitely 'acquainted with grief,' as no one else." Neal A. Maxwell</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <!-- Quote 3 -->
            <p>"We all depend on the Savior; none of us can be saved without Him. Christ’s Atonement is infinite and eternal. Forgiveness for our sins comes with conditions. We must repent, and we must be willing to forgive others. . . Remember, heaven is filled with those who have this in common: They are forgiven. And they forgive. Lay your burden at the Savior’s feet. Let go of judgment. Allow Christ’s Atonement to change and heal your heart. Love one another. Forgive one another. The merciful will obtain mercy." Dieter F. Uchtdorf</p>
